# Trading Algorithm Backtesting System

This project is designed to backtest and evaluate multiple trading algorithms. It allows for a competitive environment where up to 500 trading algorithms can compete based on their performance in generating correct buy/sell signals leading to profits.

## Key Features
- Backtest trading algorithms with historical data
- Evaluate performance based on correct buy/sell signals
- Manual competition triggering mechanism
- Toggleable logging for data printing and optional file saving
- Local deployment with Docker, scalable to Kubernetes

## Project Structure
1. **Data Fetching Service**: Fetch historical market data.
2. **Algorithm Management**: Manage and execute trading algorithms.
3. **Backtesting Engine**: Run backtests on the algorithms.
4. **Competition Controller**: Manage the competitive environment for algorithms.
5. **Logging Service**: Handle logging of backtesting results.
6. **Deployment Setup**: Set up local and Kubernetes deployments.
7. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Monitor system performance and metrics.

## Getting Started
Instructions to set up and run the project will be added soon.
